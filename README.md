#Matrix Management System
A C++ program for managing and performing operations on matrices stored in a linked list. This system allows users to dynamically create, manipulate, and store matrices with the following functionality:

#Features
Insert New Matrices: Add matrices to a linked list dynamically.
Matrix Operations:
Addition of two matrices.
Subtraction of one matrix from another.
Multiplication of two matrices.
Result Storage: Results of matrix operations are stored at the start of the linked list for easy access.
Matrix Display: View all stored matrices with clear formatting for rows and columns.
User-Friendly Menu: A console-based menu-driven interface for ease of use.
#How It Works
Users can add matrices with custom dimensions and values.
Perform operations like addition, subtraction, or multiplication on stored matrices.
Results are inserted at the start of the linked list.
All matrices are displayed in a neatly formatted grid structure.
#Technologies Used
Language: C++
Data Structures: Linked List
#Libraries:
<iostream> for input and output.
<iomanip> for formatting matrix display.
Custom matrix operations and linked list implementations.
#Future Enhancements
Add support for more matrix operations (e.g., transpose, determinant, inverse).
Enhance error handling for invalid inputs and incompatible matrices.
Save and load matrix data from external files.
